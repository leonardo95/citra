Hello,

I am sending you this email because we would like to know, since you are one of the main contribuitors to the citra github project, which software processes were used in the development of said project.

Thank you for your time,
Luís Duarte.

Hey,
 
What do you mean with "software processes"?

Hello,

By software processes I mean the structed set of activities required to develop the software system. For example, the waterfall model states that a phase has to be complete before moving onto the next project phase it results in an inflexible partitioning of the projects distinct stages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Citra is developed organically, there's no formal methodology used. We require all changes to come through as Pull Requests that are reviewed by maintainers (and possibly go through several address-review cycles) before merging, but that's it.

Hello,

One last question, do all contribuitors tend to work in the same part of the project simultaneously or do they work in separated parts that result in a final product?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project can reasonably be divided in several "modules", and while many people work on most parts of the code at some point or another, we usually communicate to avoid making large changes in the same pats of the code at the same time, in order to avoid merge conflicts later.

Hello Mr. Schlesner,

I have another question, how do the contributors know if a module is done? What kind of tests do you run to fully evaluate a module that you think is functional/well coded? And finally, what are the main priorities right now?

Thank you again for your time,
Luís Duarte

There's no real measure of "done", Citra is in constant evolution. When implementing a feature, usually hwtests (small standalone program demoing some hardware or OS feature) are ran and should have matching output on the console and emulator. For software features developed with heavy code RE aid I usually skip tests and just assume my implementation is correct since I used an authoritative reference.
 
Main project priorities right now (even though development is a bit slow) is improving speed and compatbility. There's no roadmap, but steps to achieve these include a smarter hardware rendering implementation that avoids synchronizing the GPU with the CPU frequently, a JIT recompiler for the ARM core and implementation of missing GPU and OS features.

Again, thank you for your time.

Hello, I'm a student from University of Porto currently getting a masters in Computer Engennering
and I'm supossed, with a few colleagues, analyse a open-source project and we chose Citra.
However  we are currently having some questions we would hope you could answer. We know that the project has different modules can you please tell us a basic outline of those modules and their relations? Also, in the Citra forlder src you have different folders, can you please tell us what those folders concern and relate(citra, citra_qt, commons, core and video_core)?

Best regards,
André Barros

Hi André,

Sorry for the delay - I don't often check this email account. At the top level, the folders are:
- dist - Files used just for building the final distributable binary (e.g. icons)
- externals - Third party modules that Citra uses
- hooks - These are rules that enforce stylistic things when committing
- src - The Citra main project source code

Within src, the structure is as follows:
- citra - This is just a bare-minimum CLI interface for Citra. It has no emulation code.
- citra_qt - This is a Qt frontend for Citra. It's mostly GUI/debugger code, and no emulation code.
- common - This is just common boilerplate code used throughout the emulator for utility-type things
- core - This is the 'core' emulator, which includes mostly CPU, memory, filesystem, and OS emulation of the 3DS. Within this, there is:
    - arm - The main CPU emulator, which is for ARM11
    - file_sys - Emulates 3DS' file system(s)
    - gdbstub - Interface for using GDB as a debugger with Citra, not any core emulation
    - hle - "High level emulation" components (lookup HLE if you're not sure what it is), this is basically where our 3DS OS emulation is
    - hw - Low level hardware emulation (which is very little, since Citra mostly emulates 3DS' software environment, not the actual hardware peripherals)
    - loader - Code to load binary executables
    - tracer - Debugger code, not that important
- video_core - This is the GPU emulator, which includes code for emulating 3DS' Pica GPU, as well as an implementation of a software renderer and an OpenGL-based renderer


Hope that helps a bit.

Regards,
bunnei
